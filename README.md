#### Agrep


An essential part of Glimpse is Agrep, - the approximate GREP for fast fuzzy string searching. Files are searched for a string or regular expression, with approximate matching capabilities and user-definable records. Developed 1989-1991 by Udi Manber, Sun Wu et al. at the University of Arizona.

The official Agrep repository can be found on https://github.com/Wikinaut/agrep .
